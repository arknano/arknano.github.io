# How the gosh darn heck do I run my own game jam

Running a game jam isn't that hard, but a lot of people aren't sure where to start! This guide is intended to serve as a getting started resource.

Note: I'm talking about game jams here, but there's no reason you can't swap out the word "game" with "music" or "art" or whatever you want! Some stuff will be game specific, but you can use your noggin ey?

## What you need to run a game jam
There's really only two things you need:
1. The motivation and desire to do a little work
2. A cool idea for a game jam
I can't really help you with the first one, but for the second one, there's a neat trick... All game jam ideas are cool! You don't need to have a theme or any of that, you can just pick a start and end date, and tell some people to make a game in between!

But, ok, most game jams have some kind of concept to rally around. I'm going to call this the **Conceit**.

## The Conceit
As in, an organising theme or concept. The conceit for the film, etc. Anyway, this is what the jam is for! This could be the community it takes place in, who the games are intended for or the intended format. 

 - **Community Jam:** Based around a specific community. For example, Slam Jam is for members of the SA Gamedev community. Brackeys Jam is for people who like Brackeys content.
 - **Technology Jam:** Based around a specific technology. Unreal Megajam is a classic example for this. Godot Jam. Or maybe you're making a jam for games that work on actual gameboy hardware!
 - **Vibe Jam:** Based around a specific vibe, like 1-Bit Jam or LOWREZJAM or GBJam. Games submitted should match the vibe, and maybe there's specific rules (like colour depth or resolution) to enforce that
 - **Goal Jam:** Games should be built to meet some sort of goal - like be educational, or send a message, or have a conversation about some social issue.

Most likely if you're reading this guide, the Community Jam is the main conceit for you, since you're looking to make a jam for people in your community, but you could throw another conceit in there as well! (e.g. i want to make cool educational games with my local community)

The Conceit of the jam is the ongoing ultimate vibe of the jam, and it probably doesn't change between iterations of the jam, if the jam becomes a series of jams! What probably will change between iterations is the **Theme**.

## The Theme
Ok, so you've got the reason you're getting a bunch of people together to make games sorted. That might be all you need, but most jams also have a Theme, which is the north star for that particular jam. It provides a touchpoint for all the games being developed, and a guiding light for concept generation to move towards. Some people can spew game concepts out like a fire hydrant, but other people need something to get them started, a foundation to build from. Typically, the Theme **must** be represented in the submissions in some way in order for them to be valid (though, usually, this is not enforced).

Themes come in two distinct flavors - words/phrases and rulesets.

- **Words/Phrases:** By far the most common theme type. A little something something to get your creative juices going. This could range from a single word "Fracture" to a mechanics suggestion "You are the enemy". Interpretation of these themes is up to the developer.
- **Rulesets:** A specific thing or set of things you want participants to do, such as making a game with only one input, three minutes long, or whatever. This might sound a lot like the Vibe Jam conceit, and well, it is, but you might use this with other conceits for a special jam!

Since I think its harder to come up with, I'm going to focus on the Word/Phrase type of theme (I think you either have an idea for a ruleset theme or you don't). You can sort of go as vague or as specific as you'd like with these.
- **A Vibey Cool Word:** Just some kind of evocative word that could encompass a lot of stuff. This will be the most broad option. "Switch", "Fracture", "Darkness"
- **A Specific Word:** Some kind of word that immediately evokes some kind of emotion, concept or object in your mind (though exactly what it evokes will differ person to person!). "Plants", "Joy", "Trains"
- **An Evocative Phrase:** A short phrase that sounds cool or leans in some direction or another. These might imply some kind of mechanic or game concept, but don't go so far as to give you anything concrete "Out of reach", "Stronger together", "Change the rules"
- **Here's the Idea:** A description of a mechanic or narrative concept that participants can use as a core part of their game. Keep in mind that people will still interpret this in different ways, and probably also in ways that aren't actually game mechanics! "You are the enemy", "Healing hurts", "No player characters"

What type of theme people will vibe with or find most useful will vary wildly, so do whatever you think is most fun. A vague theme gives the most freedom, but also provides the least foundation for concept generation. Giving them a mechanic to use will inherently limit freedom, but its a great place to start for ideation.

Personally, I like the theme to be vague, but I also think restriction breeds creativity (that's part of why we're timeboxing our game development, right?), so how do we have the best of both worlds? **Modifiers**!

## Modifiers
Modifiers are extra themes you can dump into your jam to spice it up. It's important that these are optional... If they're not, they're just part of your theme! I'll credit Global Game Jam for this, in Slam Jam I call them **Mutators** because I'm cool and edgy like that.

I suggest if your theme is vague, you put in at least a couple of quite specific Modifiers so you get the best of both worlds! I'm not sure if there's an ideal number of Modifiers. Slam Jam uses 4 because that's how many I came up with for Slam Jam 1. If you're going to have them, more is probably better than less! (Global Game Jam often has over a dozen)

Now that you have a solid idea of what people will actually be doing in your jam, it's time to start thinking about the **Scheduling**!

## Scheduling
There's two main parts of jam scheduling. When is it, and how long is it? I'd suggest you sort out the length part first.

- **Less than 48 Hours:** Ouch. Certainly doable but I wouldn't expect a lot of quality out of the submissions!
- **48/72 Hours:** This is the classic jam format, most in-person game jams will use this length because it's about the maximum amount of time you can spend on-site without losing your mind. Short timeframe means games will tend towards simpler, but motivation will tend to remain high throughout which can result in some true bangers. Some people say these types of jams promote crunch culture, make your own call on that.
- **1 Week:** Do people do 1 week jams? I don't know. I don't recommend it, it's awkward to decide if it starts or ends on a weekend, which is likely where the majority of work will happen.
- **9 Days:** I think this is the best amount of time for an online game jam, and I won't be taking opinions to the contrary. 9 Days lets you start the jam on a Friday evening and end it on a Sunday evening. Perfect? Two weekends and a week. The relatively short timeframe keeps scope tight and motivation high (theoretically) and many participants will run it just as two weekends.
- **2 Weeks:** A very common online jam format. All the benefits and downsides of the above. It's cleaner to put on a calendar than 9 days, but I'm not convinced the extra week days help a lot.
- **1 Month:** This is the standard long-format jam length, and obviously provides a lot of time for ideation development. The main downside to this is that it also provides a lot of time for procrastination and over-scoping. Generally I would not recommend this.
- **Longer than 1 Month:** I dunno man is it even a game jam any more?

I don't have a lot of general advice for picking a length - other than that people can always participate for less time in a longer jam (e.g. one weekend spent on a 1 month jam), and it's important you encourage that to help capture more participants!

When it comes to when the jam comes, there's a few key considerations.
- **Public Holidays:** Varies from person to person, but often people spend time with family on public holidays, so it might be useful to avoid them.
- **Major Industry Events:** Don't schedule your jam to happen at the same time as Melbourne International Games Week! Unless your jam is for people who aren't going to MIGW. Ok, I've changed my mind, do it.
- **Local Industry Events:** You probably don't want your jam ending while a local event is taking place, but maybe it ending the day before is a cool opportunity! Similarly, you probably don't want conflicting local jams, so talk to the other event organisers in your community!
- **Major Game Jams:** Broadly I'd advise against conflicting with major jams such as GMTK Jam, Ludum Dare, etc. You don't want to make your participants have to choose between yours and one they participate in regularly. If your jam is compatible (e.g. no conflicting rules) with the other jam it can work, though!
- **Time of Year:** Even if you avoid the public holidays, there are some awkward times to do a game jam. It could be between holidays, or in a time of year that has a lot of jams, or when school exams are on, that sort of thing. This can be really hard to gauge, so I wouldn't worry about it too much, but worth keeping in mind
