Running a game jam isn't that hard, but a lot of people aren't sure where to start! This guide is intended to serve as a getting started resource.

Note: I'm talking about game jams here, but there's no reason you can't swap out the word "game" with "music" or "art" or whatever you want! Some stuff will be game specific, but you can use your noggin ey?
 
## Planning the Jam
There's really only two things you need:
1. The motivation and desire to do a little work
2. A cool idea for a game jam
I can't really help you with the first one, but for the second one, there's a neat trick... All game jam ideas are cool! You don't need to have a theme or any of that, you can just pick a start and end date, and tell some people to make a game in between!

But, ok, most game jams have some kind of concept to rally around. I'm going to call this the **Conceit**.

### The Conceit
As in, an organising theme or concept. The conceit for the film, etc. Anyway, this is what the jam is for! This could be the community it takes place in, who the games are intended for or the intended format. 

 - **Community Jam:** Based around a specific community. For example, Slam Jam is for members of the SA Gamedev community. Brackeys Jam is for people who like Brackeys content.
 - **Technology Jam:** Based around a specific technology. Unreal Megajam is a classic example for this. Godot Jam. Or maybe you're making a jam for games that work on actual gameboy hardware!
 - **Vibe Jam:** Based around a specific vibe, like 1-Bit Jam or LOWREZJAM or GBJam. Games submitted should match the vibe, and maybe there's specific rules (like colour depth or resolution) to enforce that
 - **Goal Jam:** Games should be built to meet some sort of goal - like be educational, or send a message, or have a conversation about some social issue.

Most likely if you're reading this guide, the Community Jam is the main conceit for you, since you're looking to make a jam for people in your community, but you could throw another conceit in there as well! (e.g. i want to make cool educational games with my local community)

The Conceit of the jam is the ongoing ultimate vibe of the jam, and it probably doesn't change between iterations of the jam, if the jam becomes a series of jams! What probably will change between iterations is the **Theme**.

### The Theme
Ok, so you've got the reason you're getting a bunch of people together to make games sorted. That might be all you need, but most jams also have a Theme, which is the north star for that particular jam. It provides a touchpoint for all the games being developed, and a guiding light for concept generation to move towards. Some people can spew game concepts out like a fire hydrant, but other people need something to get them started, a foundation to build from. Typically, the Theme **must** be represented in the submissions in some way in order for them to be valid (though, usually, this is not enforced).

Themes come in two distinct flavors - words/phrases and rulesets.

- **Words/Phrases:** By far the most common theme type. A little something something to get your creative juices going. This could range from a single word "Fracture" to a mechanics suggestion "You are the enemy". Interpretation of these themes is up to the developer.
- **Rulesets:** A specific thing or set of things you want participants to do, such as making a game with only one input, three minutes long, or whatever. This might sound a lot like the Vibe Jam conceit, and well, it is, but you might use this with other conceits for a special jam!

Since I think its harder to come up with, I'm going to focus on the Word/Phrase type of theme (I think you either have an idea for a ruleset theme or you don't). You can sort of go as vague or as specific as you'd like with these.
- **A Vibey Cool Word:** Just some kind of evocative word that could encompass a lot of stuff. This will be the most broad option. "Switch", "Fracture", "Darkness"
- **A Specific Word:** Some kind of word that immediately evokes some kind of emotion, concept or object in your mind (though exactly what it evokes will differ person to person!). "Plants", "Joy", "Trains"
- **An Evocative Phrase:** A short phrase that sounds cool or leans in some direction or another. These might imply some kind of mechanic or game concept, but don't go so far as to give you anything concrete "Out of reach", "Stronger together", "Change the rules"
- **Here's the Idea:** A description of a mechanic or narrative concept that participants can use as a core part of their game. Keep in mind that people will still interpret this in different ways, and probably also in ways that aren't actually game mechanics! "You are the enemy", "Healing hurts", "No player characters"

What type of theme people will vibe with or find most useful will vary wildly, so do whatever you think is most fun. A vague theme gives the most freedom, but also provides the least foundation for concept generation. Giving them a mechanic to use will inherently limit freedom, but its a great place to start for ideation.

Personally, I like the theme to be vague, but I also think restriction breeds creativity (that's part of why we're timeboxing our game development, right?), so how do we have the best of both worlds? **Modifiers**!

### Modifiers
Modifiers are extra themes you can dump into your jam to spice it up. It's important that these are optional... If they're not, they're just part of your theme! I'll credit Global Game Jam for this, in Slam Jam I call them **Mutators** because I'm cool and edgy like that.

I suggest if your theme is vague, you put in at least a couple of quite specific Modifiers so you get the best of both worlds! I'm not sure if there's an ideal number of Modifiers. Slam Jam uses 4 because that's how many I came up with for Slam Jam 1. If you're going to have them, more is probably better than less! (Global Game Jam often has over a dozen)

Now that you have a solid idea of what people will actually be doing in your jam, you should think about what they will *not* be doing. For that, you need some **Rules!**

### Rules
Generally I think rules can be broken up into three broad categories:
- **Thematic:** Rules based on the theme of your jam, such as 1-bit jam only allowing submissions that have two colours in them, or a 3D model jam only allowing submissions that are 3D models. Even if you think its obvious based on the theme, you should still include it in the rules to make it clear!
- **Procedural:** Rules around how the jam works, such as when submissions can be made and whether or not participants can use previous work or paid assets.
	- Note: Consider carefully if you want to allow free/paid assets in your jam - a jam that requires all content to be made during the jam is generally considered more "hardcore", and will favour teams rather than solo participants
- **Icks:** Rules around things you don't want, such as violent, erotic or AI content. It's your jam, you can decide what is ok or not as a submission!

It's really important that you lay these things out clearly to participants so you're all on the same page about how the jam works. Don't be afraid to add new rules while the jam is underway if you forgot something!

Congrats, you've worked out how your jam is gonna work, now it's time to start thinking about the **Scheduling**!
### Scheduling
There's two main parts of jam scheduling. When is it, and how long is it? I'd suggest you sort out the length part first.

- **Less than 48 Hours:** Ouch. Certainly doable but I wouldn't expect a lot of quality out of the submissions!
- **48/72 Hours:** This is the classic jam format, most in-person game jams will use this length because it's about the maximum amount of time you can spend on-site without losing your mind. Short timeframe means games will tend towards simpler, but motivation will tend to remain high throughout which can result in some true bangers. Some people say these types of jams promote crunch culture, make your own call on that.
- **1 Week:** Do people do 1 week jams? I don't know. I don't recommend it, it's awkward to decide if it starts or ends on a weekend, which is likely where the majority of work will happen.
- **9 Days:** I think this is the best amount of time for an online game jam, and I won't be taking opinions to the contrary. 9 Days lets you start the jam on a Friday evening and end it on a Sunday evening. Perfect? Two weekends and a week. The relatively short timeframe keeps scope tight and motivation high (theoretically) and many participants will run it just as two weekends.
- **2 Weeks:** A very common online jam format. All the benefits and downsides of the above. It's cleaner to put on a calendar than 9 days, but I'm not convinced the extra week days help a lot.
- **1 Month:** This is the standard long-format jam length, and obviously provides a lot of time for ideation development. The main downside to this is that it also provides a lot of time for procrastination and over-scoping. Generally I would not recommend this.
- **Longer than 1 Month:** I dunno man is it even a game jam any more?

I don't have a lot of general advice for picking a length - other than that people can always participate for less time in a longer jam (e.g. one weekend spent on a 1 month jam), and it's important you encourage that to help capture more participants!

When it comes to when the jam comes, there's a few key considerations.
- **Public Holidays:** Varies from person to person, but often people spend time with family on public holidays, so it might be useful to avoid them.
- **Major Industry Events:** Don't schedule your jam to happen at the same time as Melbourne International Games Week! Unless your jam is for people who aren't going to MIGW. Ok, I've changed my mind, do it.
- **Local Industry Events:** You probably don't want your jam ending while a local event is taking place, but maybe it ending the day before is a cool opportunity! Similarly, you probably don't want conflicting local jams, so talk to the other event organisers in your community!
- **Major Game Jams:** Broadly I'd advise against conflicting with major jams such as GMTK Jam, Ludum Dare, etc. You don't want to make your participants have to choose between yours and one they participate in regularly. If your jam is compatible (e.g. no conflicting rules) with the other jam it can work, though!
- **Time of Year:** Even if you avoid the public holidays, there are some awkward times to do a game jam. It could be between holidays, or in a time of year that has a lot of jams, or when school exams are on, that sort of thing. This can be really hard to gauge, so I wouldn't worry about it too much, but worth keeping in mind

## Prepping the Jam
Ok, so you've got a banging plan for your jam, now you just need to make it happen. This is where the "work" happens, but don't be afraid, it's a lot easier than making a video game.
### Jam Page
In order for people to participate, you need a place to host the jam. You can do this anywhere I guess, just have people upload games to a Discord channel or something, but the defacto jam hosting website is [itch.io](https://itch.io/), which is also where everyone releases their in-progress indie games anyway, so its convenient.
Anybody with an itch account can host a game jam. Itch [has their own documentation](https://itch.io/docs/creators/game-jams) regarding the specifics of the features, so I'm just going to focus on broad strokes worth considering rather than telling you exactly how to set it up (its very simple!)
#### Content
So, like, what needs to go on the jam page?

- **Say Hello:** Give visitors an idea of what the heck your jam is all about.
- **The Theme/Modifiers:** These should definitely be here after the jam has started, but depending on your jam you might announce them beforehand. Making some nice pictures for these is a bonus, but absolutely not necessary.
- **Rules:** Or they don't exist!
- **FAQ:** Preempt some common questions and answer them here. Whenever you receive a question about the jam, consider if it should also go into the FAQ. You might be better off adjusting the jam rules/description to be more clear, but use your discretion.
- **Community Call to Action:** Include a link and call to join whatever community you're hosting from, or the jam forums, depending on how you're handling that. Tell participants where they can go to hang out and ask questions.
- **Credits:** Give a shoutout to yourself and anybody who helped out with the jam. Why not!

Your page doesn't need to be pretty! But if you have the skills (or friends that do) its nice to spend some time giving it a brand. Your options are fairly limited with the basic jam page HTML and appearance settings, but you can request custom CSS access from the itch team via support and they will generally grant it without any fuss.
#### Ranked vs Non-ranked
Itch allows for Ranked jams, which allows for voting on the submissions under criteria you set. If you want your jam to act more like a competition, then this is perfect. Generally I would recommend avoiding it for smaller jams however, as the winners tend to just be whoever was most prolific in sharing their game. If you want to crown winners, I'd suggest going with judges rather than community voting (though perhaps you could have one category as a "People's Choice" award) - itch does allow you to set specific users as judges. 

My general advice is that game jams should be an opportunity for collaboration, community building, and motivation - not competition. But competition can drive people to success, so your mileage may vary. Just keep in mind that as soon as you begin elevating submissions above others you create a focal point for drama
#### Custom Fields
You can set up custom submission fields for your jam, which lets you prompt participants for extra info when they submit. This is great for asking them how they used the jam theme, collecting credits, or any other info you're interested! Just keep in mind that often people will neglect to fill these fields out since they are often submitting under time pressure.
#### Enable Community
This adds forums for your jam, which is super cool if you're not building it for a specific existing community. If you are, though, my advice is to uncheck this option, since your community will generally already have a place to talk to one another! In my experience, the jam forums end up mostly people shouting into the void.
#### Visibility
Until you click the "Published" checkbox, nobody will be able to see your jam (except people you add), so obviously only do this one you're happy with the page! You can publish the jam whenever you want, it won't start until the time and date you set.

The "Unlisted" checkbox is interesting. It will hide the jam from itch's built-in jam discovery pages, which is probably useful if you are running a community jam and you don't want some random kid from Canada submitting to your jam. 

### Jam Community (Discord)
As mentioned before, itch jams can have a forum associated with them, but as I also mentioned, I don't really recommend it. An instant messaging space will do a lot more for the sense of community among participants, which leads us pretty much to Discord as your only real option (in 2025).

At a minimum, I'd recommend you have an announcements channel and a general jam channel. You might expand that to include a wip channel, but unless your jam is quite big, a single channel is plenty. Avoid the instinct to add a ton of channels for different game engines or separating jam and casual chatter - the more channels you have, the less active each one will feel. I would only consider adding more user channels if similar conversations regularly occur and they impact the quality of discussion in your main channel.

Allow users to opt-in to announcement pings, and use them liberally for engagement. You might consider two ping roles, one for jam announcements and another for stuff like daily wip checkins and whatnot, but don't overcomplicate it.
### Promoting the Jam
Honestly, I don't think I have useful advice for this. Just post about it. I aim to announce the jam one month in advance, as that gives people enough notice to set aside time without it being so far off they forget. My typical approach is to announce a Modifier per week in the leadup to the jam - mostly as an excuse to repost about the jam!

Where exactly you can promote will depend a lot. I only have experience promoting for community jams, so I just post in the relevant community!

## Jam Time!
You've planned the jam. You've prepped the jam. Now its time to jam! But uhhh, what does that actually mean for you as the host? Your main goal is to make the jam feel like more than just a bunch of disparate teams making projects in their own corners of the internet. Your want them to come away from the jam remembering the *jam* - not just the game they made. Easier said than done, but hopefully this helps.
### Be Present
It's important that you are around and actively participating in the jam community, even if you aren't actually participating in the jam yourself (you definitely should, though). If you can't bother to be engaged, why should anybody else? If you can't be present for some reason, find someone to back you up!

It's especially important to be around at the start and end of the jam, for what I hope are obvious reasons.
### Encourage Sharing
Regularly prompt for participants to share their progress! Encourage people to share scuffed and broken things, as it will help remind everyone else that gamedev is hard and help build that sense of community. A daily WIP thread is a great way to do this, but there should also be a place for people to share things as they desire.
### Matchmake
Help participants find teams! You can formalise this into a specific team making system (such as a survey and then placing those people into teams yourself) or just help people looking for teams connect to each other. Often people will just shout into the void about wanting a team instead of looking for similar posts that have already been made, so being a little cupid and connecting those messages can help a lot! Providing a specific place where people can look for a team is a good idea too, though they will definitely also just post in your general channel either way!
### Reminders
Get everybody's attention at key milestones of the jam; first weekend done, 2 days to go, 1 hour to go, etc. This serves a dual purpose of getting eyes back onto the jam and highlighting the time limit, but also being able to pass some words of encouragement or advice about the jam. For example, when there's a day to go, I always remind jammers to make a game build, like, now. Reminding them to make their itch page before submitting is a classic, too!
### Don't Sweat the Deadline
Three things are certain in life; death, taxes and a team or two deciding to make their build exactly 1 minute before the jam deadline and then missing it. But, like, who cares! You can generate late upload links via the jam dashboard, and I encourage you to offer them to anybody who missed the deadline - after all the point was to get people creating, right? I usually remind people in the "jam's over" announcement that late links are available.

___
## Jam Moderation
While I'm not going to into community moderation as a topic here, there's a couple of jam-specific things to keep in mind beyond the deadline one above.
### Remove vs Disqualify
On the jam entry page, you have two buttons for moderation; you can use one or the other depending on the severity of the response needed.
- **Remove Submission:** Completely deletes the submission from the jam. This does not affect their upload to itch, but it will no longer appear in the jam submissions or show as a submission to your jam on their game page.
- **Disqualify Submission:** The submission is hidden from the submissions list and can't be rated (if ranking is on). The entry page will still exist and the game page will still show it as a submission to your jam.
### Pre-made Submissions
If your jam is unlisted on itch, you will almost certainly get one or two submissions from randoms on itch who for some reason think submitting their game to every jam on the site is a useful marketing strategy. The jam entry page won't tell you a lot, but if you go to the game page itself, you will be able to see exactly when the game was first published, and when it was last updated. Obviously if this is before your jam started, you can safely remove the submission. Sometimes its a bit harder to work out, as the user could just publish a new page after the jam starts, so use your instincts and/or reach out to them. If they're not in your jam community, you can pretty safely yeet it.
### Rule-breaking Submissions
How you deal with submissions that break the jam rules is obviously going to vary a lot based on the rule itself and way in which it was violated. Generally I advise a soft touch for members of your community, barring repeat offenders or clear intent. A submission that is made with malice and intent is obviously an easy delete, but someone misunderstanding a rule about colour depth or something is less worthy of sanction. Speak to the author and make your decision based on their response.

## That's It
That's the whole guide. I hope you run some cool jams. If I missed something obvious or you have any further questions, please get in touch with me on Discord `grafeisen`.
